The process included two coding rounds (Music Library, KV Store with transactions, Excel Sheet design), one system design (Hotel Reservation Aggregator), and two HM rounds with project deep dives. Despite borderline feedback on system design and position closures causing delays, the candidate received a verbal offer. Key focus areas were OOP/LLD design patterns and handling follow-up extensions in coding rounds.",

Key learnings include balancing LC and system design preparation, importance of clean code, and being wary of company culture red flags. Uber had the best hiring manager experience while Google's nitpicking feedback culture was a major turn-off. Declined Google's downlevel offer, Rippling due to WLB concerns, and Eightfold due to paper ESOPs preference for public RSUs.",

The problem requires allocating prime numbers (2-100) to tree nodes such that no two adjacent nodes have a sum that is prime. It combines tree traversal, number theory, and combinatorics. The key insight involves leveraging the bipartite property of trees and handling the special case of prime number 2.",

The candidate struggled in Round 4 with the duplicate substring problem, which led to an additional Round 5. Despite solving the final round optimally using 2D prefix sum, the candidate was rejected without any feedback, leaving them uncertain about the actual reason for rejection.",
