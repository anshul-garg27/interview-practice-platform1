Implement the SongAnalytics class with the following methods:\n\n1. SongAnalytics() - Initializes the system.\n\n2. int add_song(string name) - Adds a song to the system, assigns it a unique auto-incrementing ID starting from 1, and returns the assigned ID.\n\n3. void play_song(int song_id, int user_id) - Records a play event for a song by a user. If song_id does not exist, output: 'Error: Song ID <song_id> does not exist.' Each user is counted once per song, even if they play it multiple times.\n\n4. void print_analytics() - Prints a summary of all songs sorted by the number of unique listeners in descending order. If two songs have the same number of unique listeners, sort them lexicographically by name in ascending order. Each line format: '<song_name> (<count> unique listeners)'.\n\nExample:\nadd_song(\"Song A\") \u2192 returns 1\nadd_song(\"Song B\") \u2192 returns 2\nadd_song(\"Song C\") \u2192 returns 3\nplay_song(1, 1)\nplay_song(1, 2)\nplay_song(2, 1)\nplay_song(3, 3)\nplay_song(3, 3)\nprint_analytics()\n\nOutput:\nSong A (2 unique listeners)\nSong B (1 unique listeners)\nSong C (1 unique listeners)",

(2) The sum of indices allocated to any two cities directly connected with a road is not a prime number. Find the number of ways to allocate prime numbers to the cities respecting these conditions.
